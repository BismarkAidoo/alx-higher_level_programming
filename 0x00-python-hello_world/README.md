#Python - Hello, World
In this project, I explore and practice using the interpreter, printing text and variables and indexing and slicing strings in Python.

##Function Prototypes
Prototypes for functions wirtten in this project:
|	File			|	Prototype		|
| `10-check_cycle.c		|	`int check_cycle(listint_t *list);`	|
| `102-magic_calculation.py	|	`def magic_calculation(a, b);	|

###Tasks
- 0. Run Python File
	- 0-run: Bash script that runs a Python script file saved in the environment variable `$PYFILE`.
- 1. Run inline
	- 1-run inline: Bash script that runs Python code saved in the environment variable `$PYCODE`.

	-Completion of this course code.
- 4. Print float
	- 4-print_float.py: Python script that prints the float stored in the variable `number` with a precisio of two digits.
	- Completion of this source code.
- 5. Print string
	- 5-print_string.py: Python script that prints a string stored in the variable `str` three times, then a new line, then the first nine characters contained in `str`, followed by another new line.
	- Completiion f this source code.
- 6. Play with strings
	- 6-concat.py: Python script that prints `Welcome to Holberton School!` usng the variables `str1 = "Holberton"` and `str2 = "School"`.
	- Completion of this source code.
- 7. Copy-Cut-Paste
	- 7-edges.py: Python script that sets three string variables based on the string contained in the variable `word` as follows:
	- `word_first_3`: Contains the first three letters of the variable `word`.
	- `word_last_2`: Contains the last two letters of the variable `word`.
	- `middle_word`: Contains the value of the variable `word` without the first and last letter.
	-Completion of this source code.

	- Completion of this source code.
- 9. Easter Egg
	- 9-easter_egg.py: Python script that prints "The Zen of Python"by Tim Peters, folowed by a new line.
- 10. Linked list cycle
	-10-checked_cycle.c: C function that checks if a linked list contains a cycle.
	- Returns `0` if there is no cycle and `1` if there is.
	- Helper files:
		- linked_list.c: C functions handling linked lists for testing 10-check_cycle.c (provided by Holberton School).
		- lists.h: Header file containing definitions and prototypes for all types and functions used in linked_lists.c and 10-check_cycle.c.
- 11. Hello, write
	- 100-write.py: Python script that prints exactly `and that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19`, followed by a new line to `stderr` using the function `write` from the `sys` module.
	-Exits with a status code of `1`.
- 12. Compile
	- 101-compile: Python script that comppiles a Python script file stored in the environment `$PYFILE` and saves it to an output file `$PYFILEc` (ex. `export PYFILE=my_main.py` => output filename: `my_main.pyc`).
- 13. ByteCode -> Python #1
	- 102-magic_calculation.py: Python function matching exactly a bytecode provided by Holberton School.
